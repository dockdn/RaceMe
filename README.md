# RaceMe 🏃‍♀️
RaceMe is an Android app designed to motivate runners and walkers by tracking their activity and progress over time.

## 🚧 Project Status
Currently in the early development phase.
The main focus is on getting the core functionality working — such as activity tracking, user profiles, and data handling.
Visual design and UI improvements will come later once the essential features are stable.

## 📱 Scope
- Built for Android (Kotlin)
- Firebase backend integration planned
- Focused on step tracking, progress reports, and motivational features
- Future updates will introduce badges, quotes, and community events

## 💡 Notes
At this stage, expect basic layouts and placeholder visuals.
The goal is to get the app running first, and then make it look amazing later ✨
